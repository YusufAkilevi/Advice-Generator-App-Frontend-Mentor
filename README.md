## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I was able to use asynchronous JavaScript features such as async, await concepts and fetch function to get the data. And I also basically handled the errors.

Also, I learned to give a glowing hover effect by using box-shadow property:

```css
.icon-dice-button:hover {
  box-shadow: 0 0 40px rgba(82, 255, 169);
}
```

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me to find anything related Javascript, CSS or HTMl.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This website explains css properties really easy to understand and provide example codes.

## Acknowledgments

I worked alone in this project and I hope I would have an opportunity to work on an open source project with other developers.
